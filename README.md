# Sertie_UI_redesign
Welcome to the **Sertie UI Redesign Project**! ðŸš€ This is a modernized, mobile-friendly, and visually enhanced redesign of the existing Sertie website, focused on improving UI/UX.

The previous design had navigation issues, lacked modern UI elements, and was not mobile-friendly. This redesign enhances accessibility, improves responsiveness, and provides a better user experience for all users.

Features:
1. Fully optimized for mobile and desktop
2. Improved layout, typography, and interactivity
3. Hover effects and fade-in animations
4. Better user flow for an enhanced experience
5. Contrast improvements, keyboard navigation, and alt text support
6. Lightweight, fast-loading UI
